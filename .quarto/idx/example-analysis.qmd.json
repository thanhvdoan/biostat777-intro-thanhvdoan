This controls for Type I error across comparisons!\n\n```{r, warning = FALSE}\ntukey_results <- TukeyHSD(anova_model)\nprint(tukey_results)\n```\n\n# Summary\n\nFrom the visualizations and the statistical analysis, it can be observed that:\n\n1.  The line plot illustrates a strong dose-response relationship, showing that higher doses of both Orange Juice (OJ) and Vitamin C (VC) result in longer tooth growth. At every dose level, OJ exceeds VC in promoting tooth length. The jittered scatter plot adds to this relationship by displaying individual tooth lengths, highlighting the spread of data points while emphasizing the upward trend in growth as the dose increases.\n\n2.  The stacked bar plot shows how the proportion of \"Long\" lengths (≥15 mm) becomes more prominent at higher doses. This effect is pronounced for OJ. THe relationship between dose, supplement type, and tooth length is made clear when all these plots are considered together.\n\n3.  The two-way ANOVA results show that both dose ($p < 2 \\times 10^{-16}$) and supplement type ($p = 0.000894$) significantly influence tooth length, and the significant interaction effect ($p = 0.0246$) shows that the impact of dosing DOES vary depending on the supplement. Tukey's post-hoc reveals that OJ leads to an average increase of 3.7mm in tooth length compared to VC ($p = 0.0009$).\n\n4.  All in all, the findings indicate that OJ, especially at higher doses, is the superior supplement for tooth growth in guinea pigs compared to VC.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Criteria Met</summary>\n\nYou must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).\n\n</details>\n\n# Functions Used\n\n`dplyr` package: `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()`, `arrange()`, `filter()`\n\n`tidyr` package: `pivot_wider()`\n\n`ggplot2` package: `ggplot()`, `geom_bar()`, `facet_wrap()`, `geom_jitter()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_point()`, `geom_density()`\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Criteria Met</summary>\n\nAt the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Criteria Met</summary>\n\nYour analysis must include a .bib file, which you use to reference at least three unique citations.
